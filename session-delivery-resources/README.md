Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions &
code.

1.  Read document in its entirety.

## Deployment / Preparation

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including the prerequisites.

1. Follow the manual deployment steps outlined in the [AI Agents labs repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ai-agents-labs/blob/main/Lab%201%20-%20Project%20Setup.ipynb) to create a new Azure AI Project.
2. By default, these steps deploy a **gpt-4o** model. If you prefer to use a different model supported by the Azure AI Agent service, youâ€™ll need to manually deploy it via the Azure AI Foundry portal within your newly created project.
3. Set up the .env file variable PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING to the connection string you just created.
